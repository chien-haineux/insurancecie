# INSURANCECIE
Application for viewing and submitting car and home insurance quotes.

Based on a standard LAMP stack using CodeIgniter as the framework.

## INSTALL
- Execute the insurancecie.sql database dump
- Plop it somewhere in your web server
- Open the app root folder

## TODO
- Home quotes was not fully completed
- Radios and selects don't have db or form values set
- Empty messages when there's no quote either in the myquotes or view quote page
- Validation should be more exhaustive
